# Python Best Practices

- Follow PEP 8 style guide for all Python code.
- Use type hints for function signatures to improve clarity and allow static analysis.
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting (`f"hello {name}"`).
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use list comprehensions for creating lists concisely.
