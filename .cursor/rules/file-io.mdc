# File I/O Rules

- Use `with open(...) as f:` syntax to ensure files are automatically closed.
- Always specify the file encoding, e.g., `open('file.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8')`.
- Use the `pathlib` module for object-oriented filesystem paths, as it provides a cleaner, cross-platform API.
- Handle potential `IOError` or `FileNotFoundError` exceptions when dealing with file operations.
- Avoid constructing paths by string concatenation; use `pathlib` or `os.path.join()` instead.
