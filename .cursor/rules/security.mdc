# Security Rules

- Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets to the repository.
- Use a `.env` file for storing sensitive data and ensure `.env` is listed in `.gitignore`.
- Regularly review dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- Be cautious with shell command execution (`subprocess`) and sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Ensure the `.gitignore` file is comprehensive to avoid leaking sensitive or unnecessary files.
