# Git Integration Rules

- Use `subprocess.run()` to execute Git commands.
- Always check the return code of the subprocess call to handle potential errors (`check=True`).
- Capture `stdout` and `stderr` to get command output and error details.
- Decode the output from bytes to string using a specific encoding, preferably UTF-8.
- Sanitize any user input that is passed to shell commands to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
