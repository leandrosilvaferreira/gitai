# Documentation Rules

- All public functions, classes, and modules should have a docstring explaining their purpose, arguments, and return values.
- Follow a consistent docstring format (e.g., Google, reStructuredText).
- Use inline comments to explain complex or non-obvious parts of the code.
- Keep the `README.md` and other documentation files (`RELEASER.md`) up-to-date with any changes to functionality, setup, or usage.
- Ensure all examples in the documentation are tested and working.
