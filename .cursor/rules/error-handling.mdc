# Error Handling Rules

- Implement a consistent error handling strategy across the application.
- Use specific, custom exceptions where appropriate to convey clear error conditions.
- Catch specific exceptions rather than using a blanket `except Exception:`.
- Log errors with sufficient context (e.g., stack trace, relevant variables) to facilitate debugging.
- For a CLI, ensure that errors result in a non-zero exit code and a clear message to the user on `stderr`.
