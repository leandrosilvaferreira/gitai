# API Client Rules

- Centralize API call logic into dedicated functions.
- Implement robust error handling for API requests, including connection errors, timeouts, and API-specific errors (e.g., rate limits, authentication).
- Use `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle potential `requests.exceptions.RequestException` or provider-specific exceptions.
- Configure a reasonable timeout for all external API calls.
- Avoid exposing API keys directly in the code; always load them from environment variables.
