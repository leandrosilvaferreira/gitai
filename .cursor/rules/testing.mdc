# Testing Rules

- Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Use the `pytest` framework for writing and running tests.
- Use mocks (e.g., `unittest.mock`) to isolate units under test from external dependencies like APIs and the filesystem.
- Organize tests in a `tests/` directory, mirroring the `src/` structure.
- Aim for high test coverage for critical parts of the codebase.
- Tests should be fast, reliable, and independent of each other.
