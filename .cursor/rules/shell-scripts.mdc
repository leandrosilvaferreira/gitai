# Shell Script Rules

- Start scripts with a shebang (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`).
- Use `set -e` to make the script exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
- Use `set -u` to treat unset variables as an error.
- Use `set -o pipefail` to cause a pipeline to return the exit status of the last command to exit with a non-zero status.
- Quote all variables (`"$VAR"`) to prevent word splitting and globbing issues.
- Use `$(command)` for command substitution instead of backticks.
